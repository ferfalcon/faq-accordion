# FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

This is a over engineer solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Instead of just create the accordion with the hard coded data this solutions adds the following:

- Create an API to feed the accordion content
- Save the accordion content in a database
- Create a simple dashboard to Create, Update, and Delete the content

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**Backend**: Admin users should be able to:

- Login into the dashboard
- Logout from the dashboard
- Create a new FAQ
- Edit existing FAQ
- Delete existing FAQ
- Set the order the frontend users see the FAQs
- See the date of the latest modification for each FAQ

**Frontend**: Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
